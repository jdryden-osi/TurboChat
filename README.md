# PI TurboChat
PI TurboChat is the fastest easiest way to chat using your PI system data!

# How to use
PI TurboChat is built using an intuitive full-screen text interface. Nothing could be simpler! There are no pesky command line arguments to remember or configuration dialogs to interfere with the clean, modern (dare I say sleek) interface.

# How does this use PI?
It's built on data stored in PI "points" or "tags." Each PI tag is a different chat room, so if you are licensed for ten PI tags, you can have as many as ten chat rooms!

# Chat rooms are pretty hip, but what else can it do?
We have Easter Eggs! And a veritable plethora of hidden bots and services. For example:
1. $/Gauge/\<tag name\> will show a linear gauge with live data
2. $/Logo will show the PI logo -- all on one screen!
3. PI tag values can be embedded in your messages by enclosing the tag name in grave characters (``). For example: My current Sinusoid value is \`Sinusoid\`

# Who built this?
The Espresso Team built this. Well, at least those team members who were available and able to help out. Also one of our fearless TPMs helped out and didn't take too long to provide us with good customer feedback.
